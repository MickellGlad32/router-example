    <div>This exercise is about making lists</div><br>
    <div>Here's what I like about lists: </div><br>


    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lots of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in<br>
            threes is cool</li><br>
        <div>When you make a ist, do it in this order: </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        <ol>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

    </ul>
